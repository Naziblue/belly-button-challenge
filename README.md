# Belly Button Biodiversity Interactive Dashboard

## Overview

This project involves building an interactive dashboard to explore the Belly Button Biodiversity Dataset, which catalogs the microbes that colonize human navels. The dataset reveals that a small handful of microbial species were present in more than 70% of people, while the rest were relatively rare.

## Features

The dashboard includes the following visualizations:

1. A horizontal bar chart with a dropdown menu to display the top 10 OTUs found in that individual.
2. A bubble chart that displays each sample.
3. A gauge chart to plot the weekly washing frequency of the individual.
4. A display for the sample metadata, i.e., an individual's demographic information.

## Technologies Used

* D3.js for reading in samples.json and manipulating the DOM.
* Plotly.js for creating the interactive visualizations.
* Bootstrap for the page layout.

## How to Run

Open `index.html` in a modern web browser. Select a sample from the dropdown menu to update all of the charts with the selected sample's data.

## Data Source
